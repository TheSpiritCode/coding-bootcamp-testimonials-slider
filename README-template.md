## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Learning more and more about grid styling and rows/columns positioning.

Building slider with Vanilla JS was also a challenge, however learning about transform property gave me plenty of space for logic magic!
